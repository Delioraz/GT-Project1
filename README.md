# :computer: Webssite to share GT Series

 ## :raising_hand: My first website developed

<p align="justify">
This project has been a journey of learning and discovery. By developing a website to promote the movie Gran Turismo using only <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, I challenged myself to create an intuitive and visually striking interface. Building interactive elements and optimizing for different devices were some of the challenges that allowed me to deepen my knowledge. With this project, I take my first steps into web development and am excited to explore new technologies and enhance my skills.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was with the "Contact" and "Games" pages. In the "Contact" page, the form layout was quite tricky to design, both to ensure a visually appealing and well-organized structure. Additionally, it took me some time to figure out how to adjust the responsiveness properly. On the "Games" page, the transition effects for the cards were a challengeâ€”understanding this concept in CSS requires extra thought. In the end, I managed to achieve the result I wanted.

The next step is to continue my studies with a focus on Front-end (and eventually aim for Full-stack development in the future) to ensure my continuous growth. I plan to explore new technologies and stay updated with industry trends.
